# Step 13 - REST Controllers for Command

In this step we are going to finally create some REST endpoints for invoking the policy commands we defined in `policy-cmd`.
After this step, everything should be already ready to test and enjoy our CQRS-ES project.

**Note**: I am not going to create separate DTOs for the Controllers or any other stuff for the shake of simplicity. But, consider this in your real projects ;)

Let's go to the action!

First, let's create some core interfaces and abstract classes to handle the REST responses etc...

`BaseResponse.java` will be created in `policy-common` module as following
```java

```
