# Step 6 - Event Store implementation
**Event Store** is the core component of ES (Event Sourcing). 

This is an overview:

- Event Store is a database designed to store events, which represent state changes in a system, rather than the current state itself. Each event captures a specific change that occurred at a particular point in time.
- Events are typically stored in an append-only log, ensuring that the history of changes is immutable and can be replayed to reconstruct the current state of the system.

This step will create the necessary classes to create a generic **Event Store** and a implementation **Policy Event Store**

- `EventModel.java`: Contains the data that we will persist in our event store
- 

`EventModel.java`

First, include the MongoDB dependency to be able to use the **@Document** annotation

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

```java
package com.merchan.cqrses.example.core.event;

import lombok.Builder;
import lombok.Data;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;
import org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.mapping.Document;

import java.time.Instant;

@Data
@Builder
@Document(collection = "eventStore")
public class EventModel {
    @Id
    private String id;
    private Instant timestamp;
    private String aggregateId;
    private String aggregateType;
    private int version;
    private String eventType;
    private BaseEvent eventData;
}

```
