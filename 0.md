# Step 0 - Docker setup for this CQRS - ES Demo
The example uses Apache Kafka, PostgreSQL Database and MongoDB.

The installation / running of those components will be done using Docker

# Pre-requisites
Install Docker Desktop and make sure docker is running in your machine
    
    docker -v
    docker info
    docker ps

Install and check that `docker-compose` is also installed
    
    docker-compose --version

# Docker network for the example
Create a bridged network which will be used to communicate the different components of the example

    docker network create --attachable -d bridge insuranceNet

Make sure it has been successfully created by executing the following command

    docker network ls

# Docker compose
This application contains a `docker-compose.yml` which you can execute as following

    sudo docker-compose -p cqrs-es-java-spring-plain -d up 

Or you can use the IDE tools like in IntelliJ
