# Step 14 - Let's test all is working for now
Before implementing some REST interface for the `policy-query`, we achieved already a CQRS-ES implementation where:
- We can execute the commands via REST API in `policy-cmd`
- The event store is storing the different commands we are applying
- `policy-query` is listening to the events of `policy-cmd` and populating the reading store accordingly

## How to test?
Follow carefully the next steps
- Make sure all the services are running using the `docker-compose.yml` (remember we setup this in Step 0)
- Run in debug mode `policy-cmd`
- Run in debug mode `policy-query`

Check both starts accordingly connecting to the respective data stores and kafka

## Perform a full test not debugging
In order to perform a full happy scenario test we have to invoke the 4 REST endpoints (`PolicyController.java`) in the following order
- **CreatePolicy**: POST http://localhost:5001/api/v1/cmd/policies using your fav REST Endpoint tester 
    ```json
    {
        "organizationId": "666",
        "startDate": "2022-01-01",
        "endDate": "2025-01-01",
        "id": ""
      }
    ```
    or 
    
    ```shell
    curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/v1/cmd/policies \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "organizationId": "666",
  "startDate": "2022-01-01",
    "endDate": "2025-01-01"
    }'
    ```
- **RenewPolicy**: PATCH http://localhost:5001/api/v1/cmd/policies/{{id}}/renew using your fav REST Endpoint tester
    ```json
    {
      "renewPeriod": "YEAR"
    }
  ```
  ```shell
  curl -X PATCH http://localhost:5001/api/v1/cmd/policies/{{id}}/renew \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "renewPeriod": "YEAR"
  }'
  ``` 
- **SuspendPolicy**: PATCH http://localhost:5001/api/v1/cmd/policies/{{id}}/suspend using your fav REST Endpoint tester
  ```shell
  curl -X PATCH http://localhost:5001/api/v1/cmd/policies/{{id}}/suspend 
  ```
- **CancelPolicy**: PATCH http://localhost:5001/api/v1/cmd/policies/{{id}}/cancel using your fav REST Endpoint tester
  ```shell
  curl -X PATCH http://localhost:5001/api/v1/policies/{{id}}/cancel 
  ```
- **Note:** Unhappy scenarios could be 'CreatePolicy', 'CancelPolicy' and try either 'SuspendPolicy' or 'RenewPolicy'

## Debug tips and breakpoints to understand what we buit until now
**policy-cmd***
- Set up a breakpoint for each operation in the `PolicyController` at the line:
    ```java
    commandDispatcher.dispatch(command);
    ```
- Use F7 to enter how it dispatches the command or set a breakpoint at the beginning of the `PolicyCommandDispatcher.dispatch method`
- The handlers were initialized in the startup of the application in `PolicyCommandApplication.java`, see how it chooses the proper handler and invokes `handle`
- Put a breakpoint in each `<Create|Suspend|Renew|Cancel>CommandHandler.java` `handle` method to continue tracking the execution
- Each command will interact now with the `PolicySourceEventHandler` which will prepare the `PolicyAggregate` and save it via the `PolicyEventSourceHandler`
- Now it will save the prepared aggregate / events via `PolicyEventStore.saveEvents` recommended a breakpoint at the beginning of the method
- It will finally persist the event in the MongoDB (check it) and produce the Kafka Event. 

**policy-query**
- Set up a breakpoint at `PolicyEventConsumer.accept` method in the `policy-query` in order to capture the event produced in the last step.
- `PolicyEventConsumer.accept` identifies the bean which will handle the event and pass it to persist the data `Policy<Cancelled|Created|Renewed|Suspended|>EventHandler.java` 
- Check the PostgresSQL database to see the data stored or changed depending on the commands you performed.
